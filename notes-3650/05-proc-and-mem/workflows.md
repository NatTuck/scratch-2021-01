## Rant: Efficient Workflows

 - Pull up cookie clicker.
 - Point out that the efficient strategy is to get upgrades ASAP,
   whether they're linear or mutiplicative.

Example upgrades for programming:

 - Touch typing.
   - Save some time typing.
   - Save getting distracted to find a key.
 - Getting an editor with automatic indentation and syntax highlighting.
   - Syntax highlighting automatically catches many syntax errors, saving
     a whole try-to-compile and then debug cycle each time.
 - Getting a keyboard-focused editor and learning the keybindings.
   - In vim, swapping two lines is 3 keystrokes.
 - Becoming familiar with the libraries you're using.
   - Especially the standard library for your language.
   - How do you convert a string to a long in C?
   - Autocompletion doesn't replace this.
 - Learn your environment's debugger in some detail. For us, that's GDB.
 - You'll see more upgrade opportunities. I suggest prioritizing them, even
   if it costs some time right now, even if you're not sure it's an upgrade.
